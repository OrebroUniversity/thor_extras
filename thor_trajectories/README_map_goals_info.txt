1. Map image information

The maps of static obstacles are provided as
	orebro_map.png for experiments "One obstacle" and "Moving robot" (recordings Ex_1_<num> and Ex_2_<num>)
	orebro_map_exp3.png for experiment "Three obstacles" (recordings Ex_3_<num>)

Size of the images is 2300 x 2350 px, 1 px = 0.01 meter
Offset of the map with respect to the global coordinate frame origin is (-11000, -10000)
See the details for importing and alligning the map images in the provided Matlab scripts.
